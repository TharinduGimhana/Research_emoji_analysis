5,"Classic shoe, nice colours, comfortable and stylish.
Would recommend",6-Aug-20
3,"C'est une belle chaussure, et on a envie de la porter tous les jours. Mais taille très large ce qui lui donne rapidement un look froissé. J'ai toujours porté des Jordan, et elles étaient toujours taillées pour mon pied, mais depuis quelques temps la qualité est en dessous, et les tailles diffèrent trop selon les modèles. Aussi, la durabilité est en régression constante. Le prix lui reste tours le même ...

Pour ceux qui hésite à prendre les toutes blanches : l'entretien est assez facile, mais il faut le faire chaque jour pour les garder comme neuve.",5-Aug-20

5,"I purchased this shoe for my 13 year old son, who has turned his 44 year old mom into a sneaker enthusiast! I never use to wear sneakers, I am a girly girl, so heels were always on my feet.

The fir is just right and is very comfortable but it is not my most comfortable Nike sneaker pairs which I use for running/jogging or brisk walking .

5,Great product. Good customer service!,26-May-20
4,I bought this shoe just for the colorway. Fits true to size. I'm definitely waiting to snatch a pair of the highs before resellers if they return. But until then I'll settle for the mids. Make me proud Nike.,21-May-20
5,"These are honestly one of the best sneakers i have bought for a long time, i rate them.",20-May-20
5,"I ordered the black and green J's. Obviously there's only good things to say about the Jordan 1. They're before the time of air, so if you're expecting the most comfortable shoe, you're crazy. Ordered these from Nike on a Monday, they arrived by Thursday, standard shipping. Crazy fast given the fact the entire country is pretty much shut down. Great work Nike!",18-May-20
5,Sticking with OG colors - this is one of the best AJ1 mids to release in years. Very clean look. Fits TTS.,16-May-20

5,The Bred color on these is vibrant! The shoes look and feel durable. Definitely a head turner! Would definitely recommend.,30-Apr-20
4,Red is not as dark as the Nike stock photos but a good looking show nonetheless. Stiff out of the box but loosens up after a few wears.,17-Apr-20
5,I buy Jordan 1 all the time and i wonder because sometimes its a little smaller so i was hesitant to get the same size. but this time it fits perfectly and comfy! i wear size 13 this one is true to size,14-Apr-20
5,"I love my Jordan 1 “Chicago black toe” mids. I think they’re the cheaper and more comfortable than the highs, in all honesty. The highs are more stylish, but the mids have the comfort. Great pick up in my opinion. I would half size up from your usual Jordan 1 size though. They were a half size smaller than all my other Jordan 1s for some reason.",13-Apr-20
5,"Overall, the quality, durability, and comfort level was outstanding in these shoes.",13-Apr-20
5,"
Love the Chi Town colorway. I don’t buy or wear AJ1 but I really like these and am really happy w them",13-Apr-20
5,If you like mids you will love these. The color is iconic and materials on par with mid quality. They fit true to size,13-Apr-20
5,THIS IS A VERY COMFORTABLE JORDAN AND A CLASSIC LOOK. CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY COLORWAY,13-Apr-20
5,I couldn’t believe it when they threw this incredible nod to the original Chicago shoe on the mids. The black toe and insole adds a nice contrast to the red and white on the upper and allows the shoe to hold its own character. The classic color blocking looks absolutely gorgeous and the materials on the shoe are flawless. I’m absolutely thrilled that I was able to grab a pair of these. Fantastic way to bring so,12-Apr-20

Great shoe, received earlier than expected.",12-Apr-20
5,"I love Jordan 1s- doesn't matter if they're lows, mids, or highs. The Chicago color way is an all time grail of mine but since I can't get my hands on the them the Chicago Black Toe ones were a perfect replacement. They look amazing in person, feel great in hand and look better when beat up. I always go half size down in my jordan 1s sim",11-Apr-20
5,I love the comfort-ability of the Jordan 1 Mid. The Chicago Toe Color Way is Fire. I bought this shoe for my nephew & he loves it.,11-Apr-20

4,"For me, Jordan 1 is the ultimate designer shoe. Fits perfect and everything. Only con is the toebox creases a LOT. Too many visible creases despite very gentle use. Nike should work on this.",9-Mar-20

4,"I just got the hyper blue mid air jordan 1 and the size was perfect and leather too, but the shoes were scuffed on the side and a little bit of the leather was torn from the front. Otherwise the shoe is perfect.",26-Feb-20

5,I really enjoy the Nike products that I get from this company as they are always in good shape and everything is clean. The packaging also is very attractive. I always like anticipating getting a package from the Nike company when I order shoes because I know that everything will be right to specification as far as my shoe size and the style of shoes that I have chos,10-Sep-19
3,"I like the look but they are too narrow. Do I have freakishly wide feet or something? I feel like when I go up a size shouldn't the width and height change too, who has long skinny little feet?? Saying that if you ""break"" them in it'll take at least 3 months to stretch out like my other pair. But wish they could make a wide version in the first place.",4-Sep-19
1,"Malgré le fait que la paire soit très belle, la qualité est loin de plaire, je ne les ai mise que 3 fois et cela a suffit à commencer à arracher le cuir de la partie inférieure au lacet (toesbox)…",15-Jul-19
5,"As a kid in 1985 I had the original Jordan 1's and the warm-up suit. I wore them nonstop, absolutely loved them and nothing has changed. These are just like I remember, just as comfortable and the new color schemes are great. I actually like the mid size better than the original high, they are a perfect balance between high and low. I def",5-Jun-19
5,"THe AJ1, best iteration of a classic in any colorway!",18-May-19
3,"Love this show, just wish they would let you customize them like they did with the air forace 1's. Black/White/Gym Red/Particle Grey in lo-top would be SAWEEEEET!!!",15-May-19
4,"I just received my order yesterday.
The shoes look great but I wasn't aware that one pair was nubuck and not leather all around. The pictures on the website make it difficult, for me, to tell the difference.",8-Feb-19
4,I ordered the Infrared version and the color is not what I expected. It’s almost like a hot pink. I really like the shoes but I don’t think I can rock this color ??,11-Jan-19
4,"Bought the red black white ones, but they honestly look orange. Its like a mixture of orange and red and pink and it was not the color I expected. In the picture for the red ones it looks red but really it looks pinkish orange. I still like the design but it does crease alot.",31-Dec-18
4,"As a wide footer, it's hard to find a shoe that fits right. Nike makes it harder by making the majority of their shoes very narrow.
This shoe is no exception. I went a full size up and the width is perfect, but there's lots room in the toe area because it's too long. I think half size up would had been good enough
-Wide footer go half size up.
-True to size if you have narrow feet.",21-Dec-18
4,"I received the ""Tuxedo"" mids. I like to call them my Stormtrooper Jordan's. Giving them four stars due to the white leather(?) being a bit stiff. Still, a nice colorway. The fit is like all the other mids I own, which is a half size larger than the OG's.",19-Nov-18
5,Can never go wrong with Air Jordan 1 Mid's - always have been and will be a classic. Run a little narrow for someone with wider feet like me but has not affected the overall comfort of the shoe for me. Highly recommend!,8-Nov-18
5,Been waiting for a while for the triple blacks to come back out favorite of all time durable comfortable (once broken in) and goes well with anything bc of the silhouette ..,9-Aug-18
5,"
These right here are comfortable on my second pair",12-May-18
5,Great quality and comfortable. Nike never disappoints!,3-May-18
4,"I've owned 3 pairs of this shoe, and there's a reason why I keep coming back to it. It's the most comfortable, everyday-wear shoe I've owned. It looks great and they get compliments all the time. However, the last pair I bought is already tearing apart after 10 months. The previous shoes have lasted me years. Maybe since these shoes are so popular",27-Feb-18
5,"Really good quality leather and these look fantastic in this colourway.
They do run a tad small at first, but after some wear they're fine. I tend to get a half size up in 1's as I have wide feet and it allows them to stretch more.
The white soles do get a little dirty, but with all of the J1's I have a quick clean after wearing brings them up like new.
These are well worth the price and very glad I picked them up.",22-Sep-17
5,"Super comfortable, goes with almost anything and cleans fairly easy.",17-Sep-17
5,First off shipping was unexpectedly FAST and FREE. This sneaker was released in the 80s and its still popular. Very flashy shoe goes very well with joggers or jeans. The shoe is structured narrow so get your right size. Good buy for an exclusive gift!,9-Sep-17
4,I skateboard a lot and the tred is still good and once warn in a bit really comfy.,14-Jun-17
4,"The fit is pretty narrow so that creates a somewhat large extra tied area, but its not a big deal. The shoes are pretty comfortable if you are not walking a long distance. Very stylish and the durability is solid. It began to get scratches on the leather just after a few weeks and the upper cloth material began to rip a little. Overall it serves its purpose",2-Jun-17
5,"impeccable,trés confortable ,pour moi c'est du 10 sur 10",16-May-17
4,"Toujours aussi belle et respecte le visuel du site, magnifique jaune et noir avec ses 2 lacets",11-May-17
4,If you have wide feet get 1 - 2 sizes higher because Nike is bad at getting real sizes,8-Apr-17
5,"As a nostalgic consumer, I can never go wrong with a pair of Jordan 1 tennis shoes. Simple yet great shoe.",23-Mar-17
5,"This is my first Jordan's and they are amazing!
I highly recommend these shoes.",18-Mar-17
4,"Very good looking shoe , confortable on feet and on eys aha.
Super good product and with good durability.",27-Feb-17
5,"This Jordan 1 mid is awesome! From box to shoes, the workmanship is one of the best Ive seen produced by the Jordan brand. The black & red colour way is my favourite out of this bunch. These mids have a narrow fit. I have a normal width feet and find them snug if not a bit tight. I find my fit 1/2 size smaller than Nike Ture Size Recommendation. I use them as street wear, probably would follow Nikes true size recommendation for court with a pair of thick socks. The cushion is on the firm side. Not very bouncy. Overall very happy with my purchase.",16-Jan-17
5,"My favorite shoe ever!!! Classic style, Durable, and easier to clean and keep looking Good. Compared to other shoes or even other J's.",15-Oct-16
5,"When I first tried this shoe on, I wasn't sure if I would keep it. But after two sessions, I was sold. Like your old leather school shoes; this shoe requires some stretching. All black is very practical for my work, I wish my kids would wear these shoes to school, but I don't think the shoes are groovy enough for them. Ideally I would have a household full of these shoes, but alas; we are not that practical. :)",6-Oct-16

5,"Overall great shoe, extremely comfortable, stylish, I would buy another pair and fits true to size",30-Jul-16
5,"First things first, this is a comfortable shoe, Air Jordan's have been like that for years, what really impressed me were the little things, the quality of the leather and the red trimmings on the uppers.

They do run about a half size big, but this shoe has taken over as my everyday shoe. Looks good and feels great.",18-Jul-16
5,"Love the way these shoes look! even though I have only worn these shoes once, they are very comfortable. I do say they run a little big so if you are considering to buy a pair i would go a half size smaller. (if you're a 10.5 get a 10) Overall a great shoe.",17-Jul-16
1,Shoes looked and felt cheap. Dont seem like the were a durable shoe.,28-Jun-16
5,"Looks great, feels great, and has great traction. Even though its an everyday shoes, I swear it has better traction than the SuperFly.4.You can tell by the way it squeaks so often!",8-May-16
4,"My husband wore these for a weekend of lots of walking in Vegas. He loved the style and fit, but killed his toe next to the pinkie. He'd def buy another pair but he's not gonna wear them if he has to walk a lot.",6-May-16
4,"i bought these a couple months ago, and now the midsole is starting to seperate from the shoe, otherwise everything else is excellent",20-Mar-16
