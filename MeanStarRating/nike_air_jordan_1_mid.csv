Would recommend",2020-08-06
1,,3,"C'est une belle chaussure, et on a envie de la porter tous les jours. Mais taille tr√®s large ce qui lui donne rapidement un look froiss√©. J'ai toujours port√© des Jordan, et elles √©taient toujours taill√©es pour mon pied, mais depuis quelques temps la qualit√© est en dessous, et les tailles diff√®rent trop selon les mod√®les. Aussi, la durabilit√© est en r√©gression constante. Le prix lui reste tours le m√™me ...

Pour ceux qui h√©site √† prendre les toutes blanches : l'entretien est assez facile, mais il faut le faire chaque jour pour les garder comme neuve.",2020-08-05

26,,5,"I ordered the black and green J's. Obviously there's only good things to say about the Jordan 1. They're before the time of air, so if you're expecting the most comfortable shoe, you're crazy.

34,,5,"I love my Jordan 1 ‚ÄúChicago black toe‚Äù mids. I think they‚Äôre the cheaper and more comfortable than the highs, in all honesty. The highs are more stylish, but the mids have the comfort. Great pick up in my opinion. I would half size up from your usual Jordan 1 size though. They were a half size smaller than all my other Jordan 1s for some reason.",2020-04-13

39,,5,I couldn‚Äôt believe it when they threw this incredible nod to the original Chicago shoe on the mids. The black toe and insole adds a nice contrast to the red and white on the upper and allows the shoe to hold its own character. The classic color blocking looks absolutely gorgeous and the materials on the shoe are flawless. I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled that I was able to grab a pair of these. Fantastic way to bring so,2020-04-12

41,,5,"I love Jordan 1s- doesn't matter if they're lows, mids, or highs. The Chicago color way is an all time grail of mine but since I can't get my hands on the them the Chicago Black Toe ones were a perfect replacement.

71,,3,"I like the look but they are too narrow. Do I have freakishly wide feet or something? I feel like when I go up a size shouldn't the width and height change too, who has long skinny little feet?? Saying that if you ""break"" them in it'll take at least 3 months to stretch out like my other pair. But wish they could make a wide version in the first place.",2019-09-04
72,,1,"Malgr√© le fait que la paire soit tr√®s belle, la qualit√© est loin de plaire, je ne les ai mise que 3 fois et cela a suffit √† commencer √† arracher le cuir de la partie inf√©rieure au lacet (toesbox)‚Ä¶",2019-07-15

76,,4,"I just received my order yesterday.
The shoes look great but I wasn't aware that one pair was nubuck and not leather all around. The pictures on the website make it difficult, for me, to tell the difference.",2019-02-08
77,,4,I ordered the Infrared version and the color is not what I expected. It‚Äôs almost like a hot pink. I really like the shoes but I don‚Äôt think I can rock this color ??,2019-01-11
78,,4,"Bought the red black white ones, but they honestly look orange. Its like a mixture of orange and red and pink and it was not the color I expected. In the picture for the red ones it looks red but really it looks pinkish orange. I still like the design but it does crease alot.",2018-12-31
79,,4,"As a wide footer, it's hard to find a shoe that fits right. Nike makes it harder by making the majority of their shoes very narrow.
This shoe is no exception. I went a full size up and the width is perfect, but there's lots room in the toe area because it's too long. I think half size up would had been good enough
-Wide footer go half size up.
-True to size if you have narrow feet.",2018-12-21
80,,4,"I received the ""Tuxedo"" mids. I like to call them my Stormtrooper Jordan's. Giving them four stars due to the white leather(?) being a bit stiff. Still, a nice colorway. The fit is like all the other mids I own, which is a half size larger than the OG's.",2018-11-19
81,,5,Can never go wrong with Air Jordan 1 Mid's - always have been and will be a classic. Run a little narrow for someone with wider feet like me but has not affected the overall comfort of the shoe for me. Highly recommend!,2018-11-08

85,,4,"I've owned 3 pairs of this shoe, and there's a reason why I keep coming back to it. It's the most comfortable, everyday-wear shoe I've owned. It looks great and they get compliments all the time. However, the last pair I bought is already tearing apart after 10 months. The previous shoes have lasted me years. Maybe since these shoes are so popular",2018-02-27
86,,5,"Really good quality leather and these look fantastic in this colourway.
They do run a tad small at first, but after some wear they're fine. I tend to get a half size up in 1's as I have wide feet and it allows them to stretch more.
The white soles do get a little dirty, but with all of the J1's I have a quick clean after wearing brings them up like new.
These are well worth the price and very glad I picked them up.",2017-09-22

89,,4,I skateboard a lot and the tred is still good and once warn in a bit really comfy.,2017-06-14
90,,4,"The fit is pretty narrow so that creates a somewhat large extra tied area, but its not a big deal. The shoes are pretty comfortable if you are not walking a long distance. Very stylish and the durability is solid. It began to get scratches on the leather just after a few weeks and the upper cloth material began to rip a little. Overall it serves its purpose",2017-06-02

97,,5,"This Jordan 1 mid is awesome! From box to shoes, the workmanship is one of the best Ive seen produced by the Jordan brand. The black & red colour way is my favourite out of this bunch. These mids have a narrow fit. I have a normal width feet and find them snug if not a bit tight. I find my fit 1/2 size smaller than Nike Ture Size Recommendation. I use them as street wear, probably would follow Nikes true size recommendation for court with a pair of thick socks. The cushion is on the firm side. Not very bouncy. Overall very happy with my purchase.",2017-01-16

99,,5,"When I first tried this shoe on, I wasn't sure if I would keep it. But after two sessions, I was sold. Like your old leather school shoes; this shoe requires some stretching. All black is very practical for my work, I wish my kids would wear these shoes to school, but I don't think the shoes are groovy enough for them. Ideally I would have a household full of these shoes, but alas; we are not that practical. :)",2016-10-06

104,,5,"First things first, this is a comfortable shoe, Air Jordan's have been like that for years, what really impressed me were the little things, the quality of the leather and the red trimmings on the uppers.

They do run about a half size big, but this shoe has taken over as my everyday shoe. Looks good and feels great.",2016-07-18
105,,5,"Love the way these shoes look! even though I have only worn these shoes once, they are very comfortable. I do say they run a little big so if you are considering to buy a pair i would go a half size smaller. (if you're a 10.5 get a 10) Overall a great shoe.",2016-07-17
